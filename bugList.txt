' create TB version
' The tooltip bug where the tooltip shape and background are different
      ' I can live with the difference, it is only colour and shape
      ' the shape is not a fault of TB as on a small TB form it works as expected, round!
      ' So, if I create a stripped down simple RC widget with nothing much in it, stripping out components we may find out what causes the square  shape in a RC form
      ' note that it does not occur in a non-RC form such as firecall...
      ' Multi-line tooltips adopt the square format, whilst the single line retain the rounded balloon.
      ' this is a feature of manifest equipped program that automatically enables the default system styles
      ' might be possible to apply older system styles via a manifest setting. Need to search for examples on VBforum and other sites, there are examples
      '
      ' This is not a real problem for the program unless a manifest is required. It will display in the older mode.
