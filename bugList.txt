' add the enumeration property to both the GDIP and TB collection imagelists and also in the github version
' amend the credits to incorporate Cristian Buse and chatGPT
' search for other credits using mz-tools and add  so that they appear on the prefs about tab
' do the same to the cpu gauge.

' extract the cpu XML reader code to a class? - think about it

' create a window in code without all the form trimmings
' amend the existing Cairo project to place persistent images on the window

' On smaller screen sizes, when the 10/-note is resized to larger size, the bottom of the 10/- note is cut off as the RC form height is limited by the screen dimensions.
' so, temporarily we need to constrain the note maximum size to the extents of the form.
' position the note to the middle off the form Y position

' we can also use a canvas to write the image to a larger background.
' Have a sample canvas RC project by Olaf alpha* that shows how to use a canvas as Olaf suggests

' test the icon sizes on 32bit Win7, XP and ReactOS, find out if greater than 48x48 causes a crash, therefore excluding the 256x256 icon
' 32x32 (24 bit)
' 16x16 (24 bit)
' 48x48 (32 bit)
' 32x32 (32 bit)
' 16x16 (32 bit)

' test on Win 10
' test on 32bit win 7
' test on XP

' if any newer, Vista + API code fails on VB6 then we can start by adding some API checks and removing functionality

Final Tasks
===========

' credits update
' XML
' setup2go
' Github release

Not going to do (or much, much later)
====================================

' 32bit to 64bit conversion but only when RC is 64bit.

' add functionality to the prefs to allow autoscaling dependent upon different monitor scaling factors using WM_DPICHANGED? Think and decide.
'    we can already size a form per monitor, all we would need is to do the same when a DPI change is detected.
'    this would help as the form resizing would occur as soon as the form leaves one monitor for another.
'    the downside is that it would only work when DPI is different on both monitors
'
'    if we implemented this would it be significantly better than the current size by monitor?
'    only because it would occur as soon the form is slotted over to the second monitor

' an alternative would be to use a wm message that indicates when a form is being moved, then we would compare the form current position to the
'    current monitor height and width or check whether it is within the bounds of the 2nd monitor then trigger a form resize.
'    for the moment this is quite a big bit work and not high enough priority...




DONE

Rotation
HTML text and images

Gutter fixed
removed manifest for TB

' help CHM
' setup2go create setup.exe

' The tooltip bug where the tooltip shape and background are different, visual styles = false removed from labels and images, removed the manifest to obtain normal styles

' mz Tools code analysis

' update the setup 2go

' rubberduck 10/-

' test prefs form size on a first start, should be 0.5 on a screen that is bigger than twice the form height

' setup2go create setup.exe

' create and test TB version

' test high DPI on 1st startup

' test DPI awareness on multiple monitors, with a manifest, allows interception of the WM_DPICHANGED message which then allows the code to be called
'   that can auto-scale the whole form. This requires auto-scaling being enabled per monitor with different scaling on each screen.

' enable save button after a prefs form resize
' "surround" code in resize - remove

' fix on call to save prefs to prevent setfocus error when not visible

' fixing the wrong form size at prefs startup
' ensure the save button is disabled during startup
' moved monitor test to occur after the prefs form positioning

' determine how to identify the screen intersection point using WM_MOVING - tested, too slow to resize all controls on all forms, abandoned the idea.
' disable the 'save button' after an auto-resize by positionPrefsMonitor
' inserting a 256 bit icon into the VB6 binary using VBAdvance
' frame around the prefs icon group - invisible during drag then visible on completion.

' widgetprefs - moved timers into a non-visible frame
' widget & widget properties in cwhelp.cls spread out
' Ensure the heights of forms are saved correctly after a resize, sometimes you need to let the background timer make the save before it 'sticks'.

' module1.bas globals renamed, eg. gbl to gblS gblL &c and tested.
' other modules globals renamed, eg. gbl to gblS gblL &c and tested.
' module1.bas globals to properties? 

' r/h and bottom gutter width resolved
' removed lots of redundant commented out code
' remove ltrim$ where not needed
' added cstr() to some numeric to string coercions
' convert latest to TB
' setup2go
' TB - test 256 x 256 icon - does not inherit the icon form a form  - bug raised

' resize controls error when testing on windows 11 messagebox
' message box too small
' XML generated
' installer generated
' update 10/- RC6 to same standard
' update 10/- RC5 TB to same standard and test - all good
' update 10/- RC6 TB to same standard and test - does not show background form
' RC6 version does not show background  form whereas RC5 and an older RC6 widget does!
' Removed unnecessary code, cwAlphaImg.cls and CAIRO_OPERATOR_CLEAR
' renamed cwOverlay.cls to cwTenshillings.cls
' better splash screen
' better help screen
' XML generated again
' installer generated again

' mainRoutine new testForRichClientVersion
' mainRoutine new testForCodingEnvironment
' TenShillingsWidget.opacity = Val(gsOpacity) / 100 moved to adjustMainControls
' DPI aware balloon text and label text improved
' drag me balloon tooltip

' underlying form cropped on smaller monitors
' unsubclass the various forms and see if the IDE still crashes when exiting within the IDE - TenShillingsForm balloon tooltip

' test a new installation by removing the settings.ini
' frmmessage form_load type mismatch, missing values for saving as the height/width could not been read
' error resizing on first run when new settings.ini - ditto
' DPi aware not automatically enabled on large monitors testing with no settings.ini, value not written to settings.ini

' add a sample API timer in code that runs within the context of the class to replace any RC timers
' replace the few uses of the RC5 timers with the new timer code just implemented, about, licence and help fade in and outs.

' add the capability to move the widget manually using SHIFT+up/down/left/right &c to the RC5 and RC6 versions of the widget

* RC imageLists for non-Cairo renders replaced by scripting.dictionary importing JPGs using GDI+.
* scripting.dictionary replaced by cristianbuse/VBA-FastDictionary.

' Test using tB collections to replace the GDIP class
' Create a wrapper around a TB collection to replace the GDIP class, for TwinBasic use only.
